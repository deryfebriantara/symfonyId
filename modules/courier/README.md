# About

Courier was designed for use with RNG (https://drupal.org/project/rng).

Courier bundles an Email channel, and a plugin which links it to Drupal users.

# Terms

 *  __Channel__: a template entity type. The entity type implements
    \Drupal\courier\ChannelInterface
 *  __CourierContext__: Specifies tokens which are available for replacement.
 *  __TemplateCollection__: A collection of templates, referencing a maximum of
    one of each channel. Each TemplateCollection is owned by an entity or used
    as a global default.
 *  __Template__: an channel entity.
 *  __Message__: A rendered Template. A template which has had its tokens
    replaced, and is ready or has been sent to an identity.
 *  __Identity__: A recipient of a message. Used only when a template collection
    ready to be sent.
